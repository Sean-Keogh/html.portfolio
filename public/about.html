<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in South Africa but lived in England for most of my life.<br>
  This means I am a duel supporter of both the Springboks and England (but the Boks first! ü§£).<br>
  Domestically, having been brought up in Leicestershire, I support the Leicester Tigers üêØ. <br>

  I started playing Rugby at the age of 10 for Hinckley RFC and my various schools. <br>
  I went on a 3.5-week tour of Canada at the age of 16 with John Cleveland College where we were unbeaten against everyone, including the Ontario state team. <br>
  I have since played senior Rugby at the amateur level for Lutterworth RFC, Stoke Old Boys RFC (Coventry) and Cosby RFC. <br>
  My favourite position to play was Scrum Half or blindside flanker. But I have played every position except the second row at one point or another! <br>
  My time in the front row was 1 game only, starting at hooker, moving to loosehead prop and then to tighthead prop all in one game! That was enough for me!! ü§£

  I became one of the youngest qualified coaches in the country at age 15. <br>
  I used this to help coach a team 2 years younger than me to 2 county championship wins and runners-up in a tournament at Scotland‚Äôs national stadium, Murrayfield. <br>
  We lost to Newcastle Falcons U17 side in the final, having beaten some very good professionally linked sides along the way. <br>
  I also qualified as a referee but found that I was too tempted to get stuck in myself to be a ref!

<p>
  After 25 years of playing I have retired to being a sofa supporter or couch coach, depending on your point of view!

<p>  My favourite Rugby quote comes from former All Black player Chris Laidlaw who said:<br>
  <em>"Rugby may have many problems, but the gravest is undoubtedly that of the persistence of summer!"</em>
